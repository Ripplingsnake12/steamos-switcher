# Session Switcher Fixes - Complete Log

## Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Session Termination Before Restart
**Problem**: The cleanup_session() function was called at the end of switch-session.sh, terminating the current session immediately after setting the .next-session file, preventing the restart mechanism from working.

**Fix**: Modified the script flow to:
1. Set the target session first
2. Execute cleanup
3. Implement proper session restart mechanisms

**Files Modified**: `/home/marc/.local/bin/switch-session.sh:113-148`

### Issue 2: Missing Session Restart Logic
**Problem**: No mechanism to actually restart the session after cleanup - the session would just terminate.

**Fix**: Added multiple fallback methods for session restart:
1. systemctl --user restart graphical-session.target
2. loginctl terminate-session (triggers SDDM restart)
3. Direct SDDM restart via pkill -HUP
4. Fallback compositor restart

**Files Modified**: `/home/marc/.local/bin/switch-session.sh:119-148`

### Issue 3: No Debugging/Logging
**Problem**: No way to track what was happening during session switches.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive logging to .xsession:
- Session startup logging
- Target session tracking
- Error logging for debugging

**Files Modified**: `/home/marc/.xsession:7-8,41-42,46-47,58,61,68`

### Issue 4: Missing Wayland Socket Synchronization
**Problem**: The wait_for_wayland() function was defined but never called, leading to potential race conditions.

**Fix**: Added wait_for_wayland() calls before starting both Plasma and Gamescope sessions.

**Files Modified**: `/home/marc/.xsession:55,65`

### Issue 5: Poor User Feedback
**Problem**: Minimal feedback during session switching process.

**Fix**: Enhanced kdialog notifications with longer display times and clearer messaging.

**Files Modified**: `/home/marc/.local/bin/switch-session.sh:13,25`

## System Configuration Analysis

### SDDM Configuration (Working)
- Autologin enabled for user 'marc'
- Session set to 'switcher.desktop'
- Relogin enabled for session switching

### Systemd Service Override (Working)
- gamescope-session-plus service properly configured
- WAYLAND_DISPLAY unset to prevent conflicts

### File Permissions (Working)
- All scripts have proper executable permissions
- Desktop files properly configured

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Basic Switching**:
   ```bash
   /home/marc/.local/bin/switch-session.sh
   ```

2. **Monitor Logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f /home/marc/.session-switcher.log
   ```

3. **Check Session Status**:
   ```bash
   loginctl list-sessions
   systemctl --user status gamescope-session-plus@steam
   ```

## Key Changes Summary

1. **switch-session.sh**: Complete rewrite of session termination and restart logic
2. **.xsession**: Added logging and proper Wayland socket waiting
3. **Session Flow**: Fixed the order of operations to prevent premature termination

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. User runs Session Switcher from KDE menu
2. Chooses target session (Desktop/SteamOS)
3. Script writes .next-session file
4. Current session cleanly terminates
5. SDDM/systemd restarts with new session type
6. .xsession reads target and starts appropriate compositor
7. All actions logged to .session-switcher.log

The session switching should now work properly without the session closing issue.
